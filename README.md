1. Entropy approach of checking the password strength
2. Fisher Yates method for shuffling the password.


### Useful resources

- [Clipboard API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clipboard_API) - This helped me for me implementing the clipboard API. The documentation is straightforward and easy to follow.

- [How to calculate password strength](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27528738/how-to-calculate-password-strength) - This helped me to have an idea on how to calculate the password strength.

- [Fisher Yates Method(Shuffling password)](https://medium.com/@lakshmanmody/shuffling-an-array-using-the-fisher-yates-method-123ceecb653b) - This article helped me to implement and understand how fisher yates method works.

- [Custom Input Range Slider](https://maame.hashnode.dev/custom-input-range-slider) - A member of Frontend Mentor discord community sent me this article it really helps me on how to set a styles in a native input range slider
